  <h4>Step 2 - Design:</h4>
  <p>We'll put together a style tile, wireframe and homepage design that showcases the planned design and UX of the site for your review. </p>
  <h4>Step 3 - Development:</h4>
  <p>After you have reviewed and approved the design we'll get to work building it. We'll be building from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript </p>
  <h4>Step 4 - Review & Upload Content:</h4>
  <p>Now it's time to review the live site (on a hidden domain), upload all of your content (photos, images etc) and teach you how to use the content management system.</p>
